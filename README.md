# Let-It-Snow-MT
Montana's ski resorts attract countless visitors every year, but there's no single place to find detailed snow reports and resort information. Let It Snow MT fills that gap by providing a simple, easy-to-use website where users can browse resorts, choose one, and view its snow conditions. Using an ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend and an ASP.NET Core MVC application for the front end, the project tackles challenges like integrating reliable snow data and creating a user-friendly interface. Once complete, it will be a go-to resource for skiers planning their adventures in Montana.
